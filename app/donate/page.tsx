        "The mobile clinic saved my daughter's life when she contracted malaria. I don't know what we would have done without it.",
      content: [
        "Sarah Nantongo lives in a remote village in Uganda, over 30 kilometers from the nearest health facility. When her 4-year-old daughter Amina developed a high fever and became lethargic, Sarah was desperate for help but had no means to travel to the hospital.",
        '"I was terrified," Sarah recalls. "Amina\'s fever kept rising, and she became so weak she couldn\'t even drink water. In our village, we\'ve lost children to similar symptoms before."',
        "Fortunately, one of the foundation's mobile health clinics was scheduled to visit a neighboring village just 5 kilometers away. Sarah's neighbor helped transport them on his motorcycle to reach the clinic.",
        '"When we arrived, the medical team immediately recognized that Amina had severe malaria and was becoming dangerously dehydrated. They started treatment right away with IV fluids and antimalarial medication."',
        "The medical team monitored Amina for several hours, and when her condition stabilized, they provided Sarah with medication to continue the treatment at home, along with clear instructions and warning signs to watch for.",
        "\"Within two days, Amina was playing again. I can't express how grateful I am for the mobile clinic. Without it, I don't know if my daughter would be alive today.\"",
        "Sarah's story is just one example of how donor support enables our healthcare initiatives to reach remote communities where medical care is otherwise inaccessible. The mobile clinics serve thousands of patients each year, providing preventive care, treatment for common illnesses, maternal health services, and health education.",
        '"Now I volunteer as a community health worker," Sarah says proudly. "I\'ve been trained by the foundation to recognize danger signs in children and pregnant women, and I help coordinate when the mobile clinic visits our area. I want to make sure other families get the same life-saving care that my daughter received."',

        '"The new classroom and learning materials have transformed our school. Students are more engaged and our test scores have improved significantly."',
      quote:
        "For the first time, our students have proper desks, textbooks, and a roof that doesn't leak when it rains.",
      content: [
        "Robert Kizito has been the principal of Nakaseke Primary School for over 15 years. For most of that time, he watched his students struggle to learn in deteriorating classrooms with minimal resources.",
        '"Our biggest classroom had crumbling walls and a leaking roof," Robert explains. "During rainy season, we often had to cancel classes because the floor would flood and it was impossible to hear the teacher over the sound of rain on the metal roof. Many of our students shared textbooks—sometimes one book between six children—and we had no science equipment at all."',
        "Three years ago, the foundation selected Nakaseke Primary School for its School Improvement Program. The transformation began with structural renovations to make the buildings safe and weather-resistant.",
        '"The construction team rebuilt our three most damaged classrooms from the foundation up. They installed proper windows, a solid roof, and even ceiling fans to keep the rooms cool during hot weather. They also built proper latrines with handwashing stations, which has significantly reduced illness among our students."',
        "Beyond the physical improvements, the foundation provided educational materials that were previously unattainable for the school.",
        "Every student now has their own textbooks for core subjects. We received a small library of storybooks, science kits for hands-on learning, and even some computers for our older students. Our teachers received training on interactive teaching methods that have completely changed the classroom experience.",
        "The results have been remarkable. In just three years, Nakaseke Primary School has seen attendance rates rise from 68% to 94%. Test scores have improved across all subjects, with the percentage of students passing national exams increasing from 45% to 82%.",
        '"What makes me most proud," Robert says, "is seeing the change in our students\' attitudes toward learning. They\'re eager to come to school now. They participate actively in class. They\'re developing aspirations beyond what they thought possible before."',
        "The school has become a source of pride for the entire community. Parents are more involved, attending school meetings and volunteering to help maintain the improvements.",
        '"One father told me that his daughter now insists on doing her homework before anything else when she gets home. Before, she would make excuses to avoid it because she didn\'t have the proper materials to complete assignments."',
        "Robert believes the impact will extend far beyond his current students. \"When children receive quality education, it changes the trajectory of their lives. The support from donors isn't just building classrooms—it's building futures.\"",

        '"After my husband died, I felt hopeless," Grace recalls. "I had some skills in tailoring from a course I took years ago, but I had no money for a sewing machine or materials to start a business."',
        "Grace heard about the foundation's Women's Entrepreneurship Program from a community announcement. Though hesitant at first, she decided to apply.",
        '"The program started with business training—how to identify market opportunities, basic accounting, customer service, and planning. I realized that with my tailoring skills, I could fill a need in our community for school uniforms and clothing repairs."',
        "After completing the training, Grace qualified for a microloan to purchase a sewing machine, fabric, and other supplies. She started her business from a small corner of her home.",
        '"The foundation didn\'t just give me money and leave. They assigned me a mentor who visited regularly to help me solve problems and grow my business. When I struggled with pricing my products properly, my mentor helped me calculate all my costs so I could make a profit while keeping prices affordable."',
        "Within a year, Grace's business had grown enough that she could rent a small shop in the local trading center. She repaid her initial loan and qualified for a second one to purchase an additional machine and expand her product line.",
        '"Now I have two employees—both women from my community who needed income. I make school uniforms for three local schools, and I\'ve added embroidery services that are very popular for special occasions."',
        "The impact on Grace's family has been transformative. All three of her children are in school, with her oldest daughter now in secondary school studying business.",
        '"My daughter says she wants to expand our shop into a clothing factory someday," Grace says with pride. "Before this program, I couldn\'t imagine such a future. Now I\'m saving to help make her dream come true."',
        "Grace has become an advocate for the program, encouraging other women to participate. She occasionally speaks at training sessions to share her experience.",
        "\"When donors support programs like this, they're not just helping one person—they're lifting entire families and communities. My business supports three families now, and we all spend our earnings locally, which helps other businesses grow too.\"",

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Is my donation tax-deductible?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Yes, our foundation is a registered non-profit organization, and all donations are tax-deductible to the
                extent allowed by law. You will receive a receipt for your donation that can be used for tax purposes.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Can I specify which program my donation supports?</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                During the donation process, you can select which program area you'd like your contribution to support.
                You can also choose to make an unrestricted gift that allows us to direct funds where they're needed
                most.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                You can set up a recurring donation by selecting the "Monthly" or "Annual" option on our donation form.
                Your card will be automatically charged at the selected interval until you choose to cancel or modify
                your donation.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Many employers offer matching gift programs that can double or even triple your donation. Check with
                your company's HR department to see if they offer this benefit, and we'll be happy to provide any
                documentation needed for the matching process.
